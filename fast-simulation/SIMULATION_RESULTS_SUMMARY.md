## Data Quality Summary

### Optimized Building Results
- All 40 requested variables successfully extracted
- Temperature ranges: 14.2°C to 27.9°C (zone temperatures)
- Outdoor temperature: -1.9°C to 33.2°C
- PMV range: -4.14 to 0.71 (acceptable comfort range)
- PPD range: 5.0% to 100%

### Non-Optimized Building Results
- All 40 requested variables successfully extracted
- Temperature ranges: 14.2°C to 32.2°C (zone temperatures)
- Higher temperature swings compared to optimized building
- PMV range: Different from optimized, indicating varying comfort performance
- Higher electricity consumption on average

## Key Differences Between Buildings
1. **Temperature Control**: Optimized building shows better temperature stability
2. **Energy Consumption**: Different heating/cooling energy patterns
3. **Comfort Performance**: PMV/PPD values indicate different comfort levels
4. **Electricity Usage**: Total electricity power differs between buildings

## File Format
CSV files include:
